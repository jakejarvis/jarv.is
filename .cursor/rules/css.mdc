This rule provides standards for frontend components, ensuring consistent styling and animations:

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui (with Radix primitives) for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Dynamic theme switching (light/dark mode) is supported through CSS variables. See [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css).
- Import and use `cn()` utility from [utils.ts](mdc:lib/utils.ts) for conditional class names.
