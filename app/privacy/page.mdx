## Hosting

Pages and first-party assets on this website are served by [**▲ Vercel**](https://vercel.com/). Refer to their [privacy policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy) for more information.

For a likely excessive level of privacy and security, this website is also mirrored on the [🧅 Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/) at:

## Analytics

A very simple hit counter on each blog post tallies an aggregate number of pageviews (i.e. `hits = hits + 1`) in a [Planetscale Postgres](https://planetscale.com/) database. Individual views and identifying (or non-identifying) details are **never stored or logged**.

The [server component](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/blob/main/components/view-counter.tsx) and [API endpoint](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/blob/main/app/api/hits/route.ts) are open source, and [snapshots of the database](https://github.com/jakejarvis/website-stats) are public.

[**Vercel Analytics**](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) is also used to gain insights into referrers, search terms, etc. [without collecting anything identifiable](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy) about you.

## Comments

Post comments are similarly stored in a Postgres database. Authentication is provided via GitHub, from which the account's username, email, and avatar URL are stored.
