## Hosting

Pages and first-party assets on this website are served by [**â–² Vercel**](https://vercel.com/). Refer to their [privacy policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy) for more information.

For a likely excessive level of privacy and security, this website is also mirrored on the [ðŸ§… Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/) at:

## Analytics

A very simple hit counter on each blog post tallies an aggregate number of pageviews (i.e. `hits = hits + 1`) in a [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) database. Individual views and identifying (or non-identifying) details are **never stored or logged**.

The [server component](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/blob/main/app/notes/%5Bslug%5D/counter.tsx) is open source, and [snapshots of the database](https://github.com/jakejarvis/website-stats) are public.

A self-hosted [**Umami**](https://umami.is/) instance is also used to gain insights into referrers, search terms, etc. [without collecting anything identifiable](https://umami.is/blog/why-privacy-matters) about you. [The dashboard is even public!](/stats)

## Third-Party Content

Occasionally, embedded content from third-party services is included in posts, and some may contain tracking code that is outside of my control. Please refer to their privacy policies for more information:

## Fighting Spam

Using [**Cloudflare Turnstile**](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) to fight bot spam on the [contact form](/contact) was an easy choice over seemingly unavoidable alternatives like [reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/).

You can refer to Cloudflare's [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) and [terms of service](https://www.cloudflare.com/website-terms/) for more details. While some information is sent to the Turnstile API about your behavior (on the contact page only), at least you won't be helping a certain internet conglomerate [train their self-driving cars](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/). ðŸš—
