My humble abode on the World Wide Web, created and deployed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/postgres), [and more](https://jarv.is/humans.txt).

I keep an ongoing list of [post ideas](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/1) and [coding to-dos](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/714) as issues in this repo. Outside contributions, improvements, and/or corrections are welcome too!

## 🕹️ Getting Started

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/jakejarvis/jarv.is)

Run `pnpm install` to install the necessary dependencies and `pnpm dev` to start the local server, and then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Pages will live-refresh when source files are changed.

Most production steps are handled [automatically by Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs), but running `pnpm build` locally will still generate an unoptimized, less-than-ideal static version which can be served via `pnpm start`.

**☝️ Note:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) is highly recommended (for [many reasons!](https://pnpm.io/benchmarks)) but this project should also work just fine with NPM or Yarn.
