Personal website of [@jakejarvis](https://github.com/jakejarvis), created and deployed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [and more](https://jarv.is/humans.txt).

I keep an ongoing list of [post ideas](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/1) and [coding to-dos](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/11) as issues in this repo. Outside contributions, improvements, and/or corrections are welcome too!

## üß∂&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started

Run `yarn install` and `yarn dev`, then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). ([Yarn must be installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) first; NPM _should_ also work at your own risk.) Pages will live-refresh when source files are changed.
