My humble abode on the World Wide Web, created and deployed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [and more](https://jarv.is/humans.txt).

I keep an ongoing list of [post ideas](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/1) and [coding to-dos](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/714) as issues in this repo. Outside contributions, improvements, and/or corrections are welcome too!

## 🧶 Getting Started

Run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies and `yarn dev` to start the local server, and then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Pages will live-refresh when source files are changed.

Most production steps are handled [automatically by Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/overview#supported-next.js-features), but running `yarn build` locally will still generate an unoptimized, less-than-ideal static version.
