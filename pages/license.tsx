      <h3>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</h3>
      <p>
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights
        holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
        rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only,
        are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

            <strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized
            to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other
            rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the
            license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying
            our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
            material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
            exception or limitation to copyright.{" "}

            <strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the
            public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's
            permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
            copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright
            and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
            restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A
            licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
            required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.{" "}

        permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
        dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
        that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

      <p>
        j. <strong>Sui Generis Database Rights</strong> means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive
        96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
        amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

            modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
            forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this

        or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
      </p>
      <p>
        b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui
        Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
        contents) is Adapted Material; and
      </p>
      <p>
        c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents
        of the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
        License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
      </p>
      <h3>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</h3>
      <p>
        a.{" "}
        <strong>
          Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the
          Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
          the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
          warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or
          other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
          disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        b.{" "}
        <strong>
          To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without
          limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
          exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the
          Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses,
          or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply
          to You.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner
        that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
      </p>
      <h3>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</h3>
      <p>
        a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You
        fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
      </p>
      <p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery
            of the violation; or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies
        for Your violations of this Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
        conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
        Public License.
      </p>
      <p>d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.</p>
      <h3>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</h3>
      <p>
        a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
        expressly agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
        separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
      </p>
      <h3>Section 8 – Interpretation.</h3>
      <p>
        a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit,
        restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
        permission under this Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be
        automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
        reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
        terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless
        expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any
        privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
        jurisdiction or authority.
